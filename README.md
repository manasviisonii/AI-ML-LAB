# Data Analysis and Visualization Labs

In this repository, I am uploading a series of labs focused on data analysis and visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Each lab includes specific tasks aimed at enhancing my understanding of data manipulation and visualization techniques.

## Lab 1: Data Import and Export with Pandas

### In this lab, I learned how to import and export data using the Pandas library. The tasks included:

Importing a dataset and exporting it in different formats.

Displaying details of the dataset, including:
Number of rows and columns
First five rows of the dataset
Size of the dataset
Number of missing values
Sum, average, minimum, and maximum values of numerical columns

## Lab 2: Visual Data Analysis

### Building on the dataset from Lab 1, I focused on creating various visualizations for data analysis. I generated:

Histograms to understand the distribution of data.
Box plots to identify outliers and visualize data spread.
Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables.
Pair plots to visualize pairwise relationships in the dataset.

## Lab 3: Ames Housing Dataset Preprocessing

### In this lab, I worked with the Ames Housing dataset and performed the following tasks:

Handled missing values to ensure data quality.
Detected outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Removed identified outliers from the dataset.
Tested the cleaned data for remaining issues, ensuring fewer or no extreme outliers.
Saved the cleaned dataset for future analysis.

## Lab 4: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

### This lab focused on data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn with the Iris dataset. I drew various plots, including:

Line plots
Bar charts
Histograms
Box plots
Heatmaps
Pair plots
